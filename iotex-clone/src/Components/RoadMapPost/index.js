            2021 will be the year IoTeX becomes the

            In 2021, IoTeX will introduce the first

            powerful DeFi & IoT applications that are only possible on IoTeX. A
            new <b> machine economy </b> will be born where sensors, devices,
            and machines will generate new synthetic assets and autonomously
            deliver monetary value to humans. From fractional ownership of
            machines to real-time leasing of resources (“machine-as-a-service”),
            IoTeX will establish a new paradigm for

            In this article, we share our plans for hyper-growth of the IoTeX

          <h1 className="heading">Hyper-Growth of the IoTeX Ecosystem</h1>
          <p className="normal_text">
            IoTeX is one of the most unique, performant, and reliable networks
            in the world, powering an ever-growing ecosystem of devices (e.g.,
            Ucam, Pebble), DApps (e.g.,{" "}

              mimo, Cyclone

            ), and services (e.g., ioPay, ioTube). Even with our incredible
            progress over the past three years, we still treat every day like
            it’s Day 1 — IoTeX is just getting started.

            In 2021, we will prioritize hyper-growth of the IoTeX Network,
            including users, DApps, tokens, partners, and exchanges. We will
            make the IoTeX brand synonymous with quality, innovation, and trust
            by strategically onboarding new partners and communities that share
            our vision. Finally, we will enrich our user-facing tools with a
            focus on making ioPay a seamless onboarding tool for new users and a
            gateway to the IoTeX Network for all.

            Our Journey to the Internet of Trusted Things

          <p className="normal_text">
            Since IoTeX started in 2017, our vision for the Internet of Trusted
            Things has served as our “north star” to guide our development.
            IoTeX was built from scratch to serve as a trusted foundation for
            the future machine economy and to secure the data, devices, and
            funds of millions of global citizens. Year over year, we have
            aggressively launched new capabilities that bring us closer to our
            ultimate goal — this year, we plan to make our biggest leap yet.

            IoTeX has ambitious goals for 2021 — as always, we have set high
            expectations for ourselves but we believe wholeheartedly that

            bodies of work where timelines are controlled by the IoTeX
            Foundation — not included are the many community- and partner-led
            initiatives that will flourish this year on IoTeX. With this in
            mind, we are proud to share our high-level roadmap for 2021:
